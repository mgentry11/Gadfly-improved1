## What is Gadfly?

Gadfly is like a friendly helper that reminds you about your tasks. It won't get mad if you forget something. Instead, it cheers you on when you finish things!

## How Gadfly Helps with ADHD

If you have ADHD, your brain works a little differently. That's not bad - it just means you need tools that work WITH your brain, not against it. Here's how Gadfly helps:

### Problem: Time Blindness
**What it is:** Sometimes it's hard to feel how much time has passed or how much time is left.

**How Gadfly helps:**
- The **Time Ring** shows time as a circle that shrinks. You can SEE time moving!
- Colors change from green to yellow to red as deadlines get closer
- You don't have to guess - you can look and know

### Problem: Getting Overwhelmed
**What it is:** Seeing a big list of tasks can make your brain freeze up. It's too much!

**How Gadfly helps:**
- **Focus Mode** shows you just ONE task at a time
- You don't see the whole list unless you want to
- One thing at a time = less stress

### Problem: Needing Rewards NOW
**What it is:** ADHD brains need quick rewards to stay motivated. Waiting for a prize next week doesn't help today.

**How Gadfly helps:**
- Every time you finish something, you get instant **celebration**!
- Confetti, vibrations, sounds, and points RIGHT AWAY
- Your brain gets the reward it needs to keep going

### Problem: Feeling Bad After Missing a Day
**What it is:** Regular streak counters reset to zero when you miss one day. That feels terrible and makes you want to give up.

**How Gadfly helps:**
- The **Momentum Meter** goes down SLOWLY, not all at once
- Miss one day? You only lose a few points
- You even get a "Welcome Back" bonus when you return!
- No punishment, just encouragement

### Problem: Boring Notifications
**What it is:** Regular reminders are easy to ignore. They all sound the same.

**How Gadfly helps:**
- Gadfly has a personality and talks to you in a fun way
- Only TWO choices on notifications: "Done" or "Later"
- No confusing menus or lots of buttons

### Problem: Some Days Are Harder Than Others
**What it is:** ADHD energy levels change a lot. Some days you're great, other days everything is hard.

**How Gadfly helps:**
- **Energy Check-in** asks how you feel each morning
- On low days, Gadfly is gentler and expects less
- On high days, Gadfly helps you do more
- The app changes for YOU

### Problem: Hard to Start Without Someone There
**What it is:** It's easier to work when someone else is working nearby. Alone feels too hard.

**How Gadfly helps:**
- **Body Doubling** gives you a virtual work buddy
- Even though they're not really there, it helps!
- Check-ins remind you someone is "with" you

### Problem: Forgetting How Long Things Take
**What it is:** ADHD brains often think things will be faster than they really are.

**How Gadfly helps:**
- Gadfly **learns** how long your tasks really take
- It tells you "This usually takes 30 minutes" based on your history
- Helps you plan better over time

### The Big Idea

Most apps are made for "normal" brains. Gadfly is made for YOUR brain. It:
- Celebrates instead of punishes
- Adapts instead of staying the same
- Shows instead of just tells
- Helps instead of judges

**You're not broken. You just need the right tools!**

## The Momentum Meter

### What Is It?

The Momentum Meter is like a score that shows how you're doing. But here's the cool part: **it doesn't reset to zero if you miss a day!**

### How It Works

- Finish a task → Your momentum goes UP
- Miss a day → Your momentum goes down just a little bit
- Come back after being away → You get a "Welcome Back" bonus!

### The Levels

| Level | What It Means |
|-------|--------------|
| 🔥 On Fire! | You're doing amazing! |
| ⚡ Rolling | Great momentum going! |
| ➡️ Steady | Good, keep it up! |
| ↗️ Building | You're getting started |
| 🌱 Starting | Fresh start - you got this! |

## Energy Check-In

### What Is It?

Every morning, Gadfly asks: "How's your energy today?"

### The Three Choices

1. **Low Energy** 🔋 - Having a tough day? That's okay! Gadfly will:
   - Give you easier tasks first
   - Send fewer reminders
   - Cheer extra loud when you finish something

2. **Normal** ⚡ - Feeling regular? Gadfly works normally.

3. **High Energy** 🚀 - Feeling great? Gadfly will:
   - Give you harder tasks
   - Help you get more done

## The Time Ring

### What Is It?

When you tap on the time left for a task, you see a circle that slowly empties as time runs out.

### The Colors

| Color | What It Means |
|-------|--------------|
| 🟢 Green | Plenty of time |
| 🟡 Yellow | Getting closer |
| 🟠 Orange | Hurry up! |
| 🔴 Red | Almost out of time! |

This helps you SEE time passing, which can be hard to feel sometimes.

---

## Notifications

### How They Work

Gadfly sends you reminders about your tasks. When you get one, you have two choices:

1. **Done ✓** - Tap this if you finished the task
2. **Later** - Tap this to be reminded again soon

That's it! Just two buttons, nice and simple.

---

## Focus Windows (Optional)

This is for people who take medicine that helps them focus.

### What It Does

You can track when your focus is best:
1. Tap **Start Focus Window** when you're ready to work
2. Gadfly tells you when you're in "Peak Focus"
3. Gadfly reminds you when your peak time is ending

### Privacy

**Important:** Gadfly NEVER saves any medicine names. Everything stays private on your phone.

---

## Body Doubling (Optional)

### What Is It?

Sometimes it's easier to work when someone else is working too. This is called "body doubling."

### How to Use It

1. Go to the Body Doubling screen
2. Choose a mode:
   - **Solo Focus** - An AI buddy keeps you company
   - **Work Together** - See that others are working too
3. Tell Gadfly what you're working on
4. Tap **Start Session**
5. Work on your task!
6. Tap **End Session** when done

---

## Adding Tasks

### With Your Voice

1. Go to the **Record** tab
2. Tap the microphone button
3. Say your task out loud (example: "Finish my homework by 4pm")
4. Gadfly understands and adds it!

### What You Can Say

- "Remind me to call mom at 3pm"
- "I need to clean my room tomorrow"
- "High priority: study for the test"

---

## Tips for Success

### Start Small
Don't try to do everything at once. Pick one task. Do it. Celebrate!

### Use Focus Mode
Looking at a big list can feel scary. Focus mode shows you just one thing at a time.

### Check Your Energy
Be honest about how you feel. Low energy days are okay!

### Celebrate Everything
Even small wins matter. Let yourself feel good about finishing things.

### Don't Worry About Streaks
If you miss a day, your momentum just goes down a little. You can always build it back up!

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I keep forgetting to open the app"

- Make sure notifications are turned on
- Put the app on your home screen where you'll see it

### "The reminders are too much"

- Try **Gentle Flow** mode
- Check your energy as "Low" to get fewer reminders

### "The reminders aren't enough"

- Try **Focus First** mode
- Check your energy as "High"

### "I feel bad when I miss tasks"

- Remember: Gadfly never punishes you!
- Your momentum goes down slowly, not all at once
- Every day is a fresh chance to try again
