# Project: The Gadfly (Context Backup)

## Concept
- **Product Name:** The Gadfly (previously Orbit/Nagger).
- **Core Function:** ADHD focus app using ambient listening and activity monitoring to intervene when the user is distracted.

## Visual Design Strategy (Makeover)
- **Primary Theme:** "The Stinger" (Midnight & Amber).
- **Color Palette:**
    - Background: Deep Charcoal / Pure Black (#000000).
    - Primary Accent: Electric Amber (#FFBF00) - representing the "sting" or alert.
    - Secondary: Slate Gray (#2D3436).
- **Typography:** Modern, rounded sans-serif (e.g., Poppins, Inter, or Space Grotesk).
- **Style:** High contrast, card-based layout, with ambient sound waveforms.

## Reference Source
- Inspired by a Dribbble "AI Note-Taking" layout but adapted to be darker and more alert-oriented to avoid copyright issues.
- Prototype created in `ui_prototypes.html` (Theme: Stinger).

## Current Task
- Apply this "Midnight & Amber" redesign to the existing native iOS project (`VoiceDay.xcodeproj`).
