### Influencer Email Template
```
Subject: Free lifetime access to Gadfly - ADHD app built by someone with ADHD

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your name], and I have ADHD. I built Gadfly because every productivity
app failed me - they all assume your brain works "normally."

Gadfly is different:
- Shows ONE task at a time (no overwhelming lists)
- Momentum meter that NEVER resets to zero
- Adapts to your energy level
- Celebrates every win

I'd love to give you free lifetime Pro access. No strings attached -
just hoping for an honest review if you find it helpful.

TestFlight link: [link]

Thanks for everything you do for the ADHD community.

[Your name]
```
