## Key Design Decisions

### Ultra-Simple "3-Second Check" Design
1. Only 3 items by default: Wallet, Keys, Phone
2. Phone auto-checked (user obviously has their phone)
3. Giant 90px tap targets
4. "Got 'em all!" button for quick confirmation
5. Voice announcements for accessibility
6. Haptic feedback on each tap

### Smart Home Detection (Zero Setup)
- Tracks where phone charges overnight
- After 3+ overnight charges at same location = home
- Automatically starts geofence monitoring
- User never has to configure anything

### Morning Prep Items (Defaults)
Active by default:
- Wallet, Keys, Phone, Bag, Headphones, Medication, Water Bottle

Inactive (user can enable):
- Laptop, Charger, Glasses, ID Badge, Lunch, Umbrella, Jacket

### Location Checkout Items
Gym: Water bottle, Headphones, Towel, Gym bag, Phone, Keys
Work: Laptop/charger, Badge, Phone, Keys, Wallet, Headphones, Bag
Home: Wallet, Keys, Phone, Bag, Headphones
School: Backpack, Laptop, Homework, Phone, Lunch, Water bottle, Charger

## ADHD Design Principles Applied

1. Make the right thing the easy thing (3 taps max)
2. Zero setup required (smart home detection)
3. No decision fatigue (only essential items by default)
4. Multi-sensory feedback (voice + haptics + visual)
5. Quick escape hatch ("Not leaving" button)
6. Progressive disclosure (+ More items for power users)
